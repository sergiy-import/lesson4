                    <p>React Native is an open source framework for building Android and iOS applications using React
                        and the app platform‚Äôs
                        native capabiles. With React Native, you use JavaScript to access your platform‚Äôs APIs as well
                        as to describe the
                        appearance and behavior of your UI using React components: <span class="italic">bundles of reusable, nestable code</span>.
                        You can learn more
                        about React in the next section. But first, let‚Äôs cover how components work in React Native.</p>

                    <p>React Native runs on React, a popular open source library for building user interfaces with
                        JavaScript. To make the most
                        of React Native, it helps to understand React itself. This section can get you started or can
                        serve as a refresher
                        course.</p>

                <div class="text-holder">
                    <p><strong>+ components.</strong> The rest of this introduction to React uses cats in its examples: friendly,
                        approachable creatures that need names and a cafe to work in.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="text-holder">
                    <p><strong>+ JSX.</strong> React and React Native use JSX, a syntax that lets you write elements inside JavaScript
                        like so:<mark class="mark">&lsaquo;Text&rsaquo;Hello, I am your cat!&lsaquo;/Text.&rsaquo;</mark></p>
                </div>
                <div class="text-holder">
                    <p>The React docs have a comprehensive guide to JSX you can refer to learn even more. Because JSX is
                        JavaScript, you can use variables inside it. Here you are declaring a <mark class="mark">name</mark> for the cat, name,
                        and embedding it with curly braces inside <mark class="mark">&lsaquo;Text&rsaquo;</mark> 
                    </p>
                </div>
                <div class="text-holder">
                    <p><strong>+ props.</strong> Props is short for ‚Äúproperties‚Äù. </p>
                </div>
                <div class="text-holder">
                    <p><strong>+ state.</strong> While you can think of props as arguments you use to configure how components render,
                        state is like a component‚Äôs personal data storage. State is useful for handling data that
                        changes over time or that comes from user interaction. State gives your components memory!</p>

                    <p>TextInput is a Core Component that allows the user to enter text. It has an onChangeText prop
                        that takes a function to be called every time the text changed, and an onSubmitEditing prop
                        that takes a function to be called when the text is submitted.</p>

                <div class="text-holder">
                    <p>For example, let's say that as the user types, you're translating their words into a
                        different language. In this new language, every single word is written the same way: üçï. So
                        the sentence "Hello there Bob" would be translated as "üçï üçï".</p>
